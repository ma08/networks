         	   ANALYSIS

For exponential backoff:

On observation, we see that for exponential backoff, with decrease in p-persistence, Throughput  and Jitter are in the same range for all values and Forwarding Delay is increasing with decrease in p-persistence.The graphs of Jitter and Forwarding Delay are almost similar for all values of p.
The delay and Jitter increase with decrease in p as more packets are backed off instead of transmitted due to the probability induced.

For additive backoff:

With decrease in p-persistence, Throughput is decreasing slightly and also not saturating like in exponential backoff.Forwarding Delay increases till 256KBps and decreases and saturates for each value of p and we observe that Delay increases with decrease in p due to increase in instances of backoff. The same is observed with Jitter too. Delay is increasing with decrease in p as packets which would have been transmitted if p=1 were backed off.


For the same value of p, Throughput of exponential backoff is greater than that of additive backoff.

We see that Forwarding Delay and Jitter increases greatly from exponential to additive backoff.
